      <h1>Open Budgets: Vanuatu’s 2014 government budget in 6 graphs</h1>
      <p>
      This is PiPP's first feature on the theme of open budgets. It is designed to further our understanding of public finances, 
      policies and the impact of the spending decisions our governments make. This page provides a broad overview of the Vanuatu 
      budget. You can delve into the budget in detail using our <a href="http://freswota:8080/#/budget/vu/2014">interactive pie chart</a>, 
      which shows in how public funds are being allocated in 2014, right down to the programme level.
      </p>
      <p>
      All of these charts are interactive. Take the time to mouse over them, click around, and you will find they provide a number of useful 
      and interesting ways of presenting the information.

      <h2>Economic Activity</h2>

      <blockquote>
      <i>
      The government’s assessment of the state of the economy provides the backdrop for the creation of their budget. It not only gives 
      officials an idea of how government revenues are likely to perform but also is used to shape the governments decisions about how much 
      to tax, spend and borrow. For the rest of us, it gives an indication of which way economic opportunities may be moving.

      In the lead up to 2008 Vanuatu’s economy experienced unprecedented economic growth following a period of reform and government 
      stability. Donor investment, tourism growth, a booming property sector and the liberalization of the telecoms industry drove 
      Vanuatu’s economy at historically <a href="http://www.pacificpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/D10-PiPP.pdf">high growth rates</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the global financial crisis came the collapse in property investment, low commodity prices and, for a while, slower than projected 
      growth in tourism numbers. As a result, banks were left with increasing numbers of non-performing loans. Below we see the impact of slowing 
      donor activity and property investment on the construction sector. The agricultural sector, providing the incomes for the majority of the 
      population, has suffered from swings in commodity prices and the lows experienced from 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
      The government’s outlook remains optimistic with the prospect of a large up-scaling in donor activity around the corner and a recovery 
      in commodity prices- such as copra. Knowing precisely when this donor activity will kick off remains a challenge for the government. 
      However, when this activity occurs, inflation could rise rapidly.

      The 2014 budget leaves a surplus - revenues are expected to exceed spending - by almost VUV 600 million, following a series 
      of sizeable deficits from 2007 to 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the small size of the revenue base and the limited domestic borrowing opportunities – including of short maturities - 
      the government works towards balancing the government budget. However, the nature of the political and capacity challenges 
      make shaping an active fiscal policy – running a surplus in good times and deficit in bad - is more difficult for Vanuatu 
      than for other countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revenue growth remains a long-term challenge of the Vanuatu government if it wishes to maintain and build on the quality 
      of public services. New initiatives were discussed in a revenue forum at the beginning of 2013.

      By the government forecasts, from 2011 to 2014 interest repayments have increased by half and foreign debt repayment has almost doubled. 
      Over the same time revenues, increased by less than a fifth, meaning that these repayments are eating into government budgets. For the 
      Vanuatu government, at present their investments are not providing a direct financial return to prevent this.
